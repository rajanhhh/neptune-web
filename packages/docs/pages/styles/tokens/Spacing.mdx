Spacing tokens as custom properties for you to use in your application.

**Note:** If this is your first time using custom properties in your application, read <DocLink href="/about/Styles#tokens-custom-properties">our guide</DocLink> first to get set up.

On our components and layouts we use a fixed list of values to define lengths. This helps maintain rhythm and ensures consistent alignment across our products.

In Neptune we use a 4-point scale that gives finer control to align elements inside components and optimise space on smaller screens, and from 16 onwards it becomes an 8-point scale where the difference in steps is more visible.

## Core spacing values

```html
--size-4: 4px --size-8: 8px --size-12: 12px --size-16: 16px --size-24: 24px --size-32: 32px
--size-40: 40px --size-48: 48px
```
